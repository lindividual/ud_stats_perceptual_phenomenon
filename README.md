# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
This is a project from the **Statistics** module of **Udacity Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree**. Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.

## Project Overview 
In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. Here you will create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

**Dataset:** [View CSV](./stroopdata.csv)

## Questions for investigation
#### 1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?
**Independent variable:** Condition (congruent/incongruent)
**Dependent variable:** Time to name ink colours
#### 2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform?
**Hypothesis test**

**H0:** Time to name colours is the same for congruent and incongruent tasks

**HA:** Time to name colours is not the same for congruent and incongruent tasks

**Statistical test**
